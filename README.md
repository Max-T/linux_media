# What is this?
This repository is a clone of tbs/linux_media.
It contains patches for the following drivers
* stid135: ts6909x and tbs6903x cards
* stv091x: tbs5927
* tas2101: tbs5990, tbs6904
* si2183 based cards: tbs6504
* m88rs6060 based cards: tbs6902SE and tbs2904SE. On these cards there is not IQ-scan (constellation display)
to support blindscan, to fix bugs and to make improvements.

# Changes in release-0.9.0

* Blindscan and spectrum upport for montage m88rs60606 based cards: tbs6902SE and tbs2904SE.
* Support m883s6060 module unloading
* stid135: BER is now reported properly othrough the PRE instead of POST error counters
* Improved correction of discontinuities in spectrum due to small errors in RF level
* stid135: detected multi-stream IDs are now accumalated internally
* Added DTV_BIT_RATE readout via dvbapi
* stid135: improper estimation of required  llr rate, causing rai multistream on 5.0W to not tune sometimes
  (green blocks in picture)
* stid135: changed default spectral resolution: slightly slower scan, but more narrow-band muxes found
* Add support for timing lock flag
* stv091x: return more correct data about currently tuned mux (instead of returning what user requested)


# Known problems
* si2183 based cards: blindscan cannot discover stream_ids in multistreams, unless it is given
 one of them when starting the blindscan. In that case, it will find the other ones

# Installation

First install the required compilers, git ...
You may also need libproc-processtable-perl (e.g., on ubuntu)
```
mkdir ~/blindscan_kernel
cd  ~/blindscan_kernel

#check out the actual drivers. This uses the default branch which is called deepthought
git clone --depth=1  https://github.com/deeptho/linux_media.git ./media

#checkout a copy of media_build. Standard media_build should work as well
git clone https://github.com/tbsdtv/media_build.git

cd media_build

#it is important to use a media_build version compatible with media
#The following version works on 14.5.2022
git checkout master

make dir DIR=../media
make distclean
./install.sh
```
